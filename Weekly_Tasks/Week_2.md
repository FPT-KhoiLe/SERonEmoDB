# Data Team's Tasks:
1. Visualize the number of samples across different emotion classes in the dataset.
2. Plot the distribution of sample durations in the dataset.
3. Visualize the amplitude waveform for each emotion type.
4. Extract basic audio features (MFCC, Chroma, Mel-spectrogram, Spectral Centroid, Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), etc.) using librosa.
5. Visualize the features by emotion labels (using boxplots, violin plots).
Note: The feature extraction step here is solely for exploratory data analysis and is not the final feature extraction process for model training.
